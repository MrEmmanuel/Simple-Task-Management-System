Task Management System Using LinkedList
This is simple Task Management System where tasks are stored in a LinkedList and can be added, removed, or marked as completed. The linked list is useful in this case because:


Fast insertion and deletion - Tasks can be added or removed efficiently.
Ordered structure - Tasks can be processed in the order they were added. 
Flexibility - We can navigate between tasks easily (forward and backward).
